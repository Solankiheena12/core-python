## What is variable ?
variable is a named reference to a value. it is used to store and represent data values. 

there are two type of variables: - local variable (within a function or block of code)
                                 - global variable (accessible throughout the entire script or program)

Local Variable: 
A local variable is a variable declared within a specific function or block of code. It is only 
accessible and known to that particular function and Local variables have local scope.

Global Variables:
global variable is a variable that is declared outside of any function.  Global variables have a global 
scope, which means they can be accessed from any part of the code, including functions, classes, or modules.




## What is data type ?

data types are a way of categorizing and representing different types of data.


1. Numeric Types:
int: Represents integer values. 
float: Represents floating-point or decimal values. 
complex: Represents complex numbers. 

2. Sequence Types:
str (string): Represents a sequence of characters. Strings are immutable. 
list: Represents an ordered, mutable sequence of values. 
tuple: Similar to a list but immutable. Once a tuple is created, you cannot modify its elements. 

3. Set Types:
set: Represents an unordered collection of unique elements. 

4. Mapping Type:
dict (dictionary): Represents a collection of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique.

5. Boolean Type:
True or False

6. Sequence Types :
range: Represents an immutable sequence of numbers commonly used in for loops.



## Type Conversion:

1. Explicit Type Conversion (Casting):
Explicit type conversion, also known as casting or typecasting
for-ex:
x = 13
y = int(x)

2. Implicit Type Conversion (Coercion):
This type of conversion is often performed by the language to ensure that operations involving different data types
