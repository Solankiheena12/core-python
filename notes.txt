Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.



###### List ######

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Lists are created using square brackets:

List Items:
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

Ordered:
When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.

Changeable:
The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

Allow Duplicates:
Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:





###### Tuple ######

Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

Ordered:
When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

Unchangeable:
Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.

Allow Duplicates:
Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:

Change Tuple Values:
Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.
But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.

Using Asterisk* :
If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an * to the variable name and the 
values will be assigned to the variable as a list:




###### Set ######

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, 
and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

Set Items:
Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.

Unordered:
Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.

Unchangeable:
Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.

Duplicates Not Allowed:
Sets cannot have two items with the same value.

Note: The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:
Note: The values False and 0 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:





###### Dictionary ######

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.


Class:
A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
class is a logical intity
class can be defined as collection of object

Objects:
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and has 
attributes (data) and behaviors (methods).

Attributes:
Attributes are variables that store data within a class or an instance. They represent the 
characteristics or properties of an object.

Methods:
Methods are functions defined within a class. They represent the actions or behaviors that an object can perform.

Inheritance:
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass/child class) to inherit the attributes 
and methods of another class (base class/parent class).
